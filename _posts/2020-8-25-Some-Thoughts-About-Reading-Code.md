There's no virtual footprint of code-readers on the internet.
What you will find though, is a large community of code-writers(Github, for example).
Surprisingly, this situation looks reversed in other fields.
But probably not to the same degree.
There are large communities of Book-lovers(Goodreads, for example), but barely any for Book-writers(in comparison to readers).
But this is not entirely a fair comparison.
You can read tons of books without ever having to write a sentence.
But you cannot just read code and not write it.

It's pleasing to read a good book that rightly sits with our principles and emotions.
What's not obvious to many programmers is that, though the motivations behind reading code and reading books might be different, the benefits are similar.
But experience suggests reading code is frustra preferable to








ideas:
methods and principles
like lisp, cut through all the syntactic obligation
can i enjoy reading code as much as I enjoy reading books?
