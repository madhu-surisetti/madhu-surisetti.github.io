title: Reading Code

There's virtually no footprint of code-readers online.
What you will find though, a large community code-writers(Github, for example).
Surprisingly, this situation looks reversed in other fields.But probably not to the same degree.
There are large communities of Book-lovers(Goodreads, for example), but barely any for Book-writers.
But this is not entirely a fair comparison.
You can read tons of books without ever having to write a sentence.
But you cannot just read code and not write it.

Thi is.
