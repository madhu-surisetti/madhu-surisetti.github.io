By the end of this essay, I hope to end up with a recipe for being a _great problem solver_.

I'm almost certain that you can only solve a problem if you've already solved it.
Unless it's a version of a problem you've already solved, I think it's really hard to solve that problem.
This means that if you want to be a great problem solver, all you have to do is understand a large number of already-solved problems and reframe the problem you need to solve into one of those problems.
When you can't reframe the original problem, you break-down the problem into sub-problems and reframe those sub-problems instead.
You have to fight the tendency to solve every problem.
Pick your battles.

Another skill you will need is abstraction.
Abstracting meaning and events to a few symbols.
Like math does.
Math is a great tool for abstraction.
So is Lisp.
The only way I know of, to be good at abstraction is to practice it.
If you hate math and don't feel abstractions are useful, you should read SICP.
You will see what abstractions can do to your life.
