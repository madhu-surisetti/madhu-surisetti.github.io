_How we spend our days is of course, how we spend our lives_

- Be a learning machine.
See what you can glean.
There's always some pattern waiting to be discovered.
Some hidden phenomenon.
Some clever abstraction.
A simple but deep idea.

- Don't encourage self-arousal, trolling, self-pity, envy, rage.
