## why use objects?
the problem with classes, like macros is they that they can be used everywhere.
you can wrap them around anything and still have a working program.
people use classes as a silver bullet for every problem.
they just don't know what the problem is.
makes you wonder if there's a _method_ to his madnessðŸ˜‰.
if you want to understand oop, you need to know when not to use it.
java doesn't.
no wonder it sucks.

like most things in programming languages, classes are a means of abstraction.
programmers need abstractions to model the world.
these abstractions can be,
- a simple variable (eg. for age)
- a data structure (for a collection of data)
- a function (a procedure)
- a macro(to define new abstractions)
on a spectrum, from simplest to complex, classes fall on the _complex_ side of the spectrum, variables being the simplest.
complex entities are represented as combination of data and the operations you can do on them.
when you define both of them together in one lisp form, that becomes a class.
this way of representing entities as data + operations is useful.
you can't know beforehand how you want to do everything.
as you program you understand the problem better and change the code accordingly.
when you're unsure of the implementation of a data type, you can change the implementation without having to change the code that uses the data-type.

you can have multiple representations of a data type simultaneously.
you can have general purpose operators.


i think nobody really knows what object oriented programming means!
