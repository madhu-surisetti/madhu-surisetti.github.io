look at this sequence:
write-program -> test -> rewrite -> build -> deploy
where does docker fit into this sequence?

docker is like a virtual-machine but lighter?

if a national government is like an operating system, a state-government is like a virtual-machine, what is docker like?
turns out docker's like a city government - lighter on the resources and closer to the operating system.

the idea behind a docker is, instead spinning up a whole new operating system, spin up a container instead.
that way you only get what you really need and get rid of the stuff you don't need.
like a GUI.
or a kernel.

you can take this idea to anywhere where you need some serious savings on resources.
where resources can be like money, time, computation, space.
think about it.

there's no such things as a free lunch.
what are the trade offs involved?
