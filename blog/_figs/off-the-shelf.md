ideally algorithms should be correct, efficient and easy-to-implement.

you could think of algorithms this way.
every problem you see, belongs to one of the classes of algorithms or a combination of them.

proving the correctness of an algorithm is hard.
instead just try to find counter-examples and prove that it's not wrong.
counter-examples are found at extreme cases.
