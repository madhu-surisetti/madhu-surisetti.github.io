Wisdom for a Lifetime

## Code
 - Representation is the essence of programming.
 - Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
 - Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material.
 - Lisp has jokingly been called "the most intelligent way to misuse a computer". I think that description is a great compliment because it transmits the full flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts.
 - I object to doing things that computers can do.
 - The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.
 - SQL, Lisp, and Haskell are the only programming languages that I've seen where one spends more time thinking than typing.
 - The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases.
 - Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.

## Observations
 - ==================================================================
 - The best way to get something is to deserve it.
 - Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
 - The less confident you are, the more serious you have to act.
 - Change breaks the brittle.
 - The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.
 - The public should always be wondering how it is possible to give so much for the money.
 - ==================================================================
 - Your twenties are always an apprenticeship, but you don't always know what for.
 - Get the important things right.
 - Most interesting phenomena have multiple causes.
 - A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.
 - Focusing is about saying no.
 - You should never turn a man's generosity as a sword against him. Any virtue that a man has, even if he has many vices, should not be used as a tool against him.
 - ==================================================================
 - He begins working calculus problems in his head as soon as he awakens. He did calculus while driving in his car, while sitting in the living room, and while lying in bed at night. - divorce complaint of Richard Feynman's second wife
 - When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
 - A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.
 - An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field.
 - Don't fear moving slowly. Fear standing still.
 - We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question that divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct.
 - ==================================================================
 - Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money.
 - I sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would have been had they been white and living in the South before abolition. Guess what? They all would have been abolitionists! They all would have bravely spoken out against slavery, and worked tirelessly against it.
 - Lies are often much more plausible, more appealing to reason, than reality, since the liar has the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects to hear.
 - People who can't laugh at themselves will always be outwitted by people who can.
 - You understand it best when you need it most.
 - The best kind of pleasure is deserved pleasure.
 - ==================================================================
 - Hindsight is better than foresight
